We May Never Pass This Way

the close of the day
out on the patio
we stare at the wall
covered from the mere notion of regret
there is a deeper meaning in this place
to equate logic for fear
for I shed a single tear to help numb its inner pain
harken onto the moment in my thoughts
crumb cakes with granola bars left for snacks
the garden you had pulled the weeds back
the fertile soil permeates the fragment of its land fertlization
we humbly tred upon solace the thoughts will last
shelter lies dormant amidst its beckoning plow
still I need a shoulder to cry on
the Martini that you drank last night at the bar
sdt pitter patter of glasses clasping together
snap shot moments in my head

golden nuggets of wisdom that come from a higher source
the scope of the sun has tainted my inner vision
a soul vexed in its derision
