What is love? 
Baby don't hurt me, 
Don't hurt me, no more
Baby don't hurt me, 
Don't hurt me, no more 
What is love? 
Yeeeahh

Oh I don't know 
Why you're not there 
I give you my love, but you don't care 
So what is right, 
And what is wrong 
Gimme a sign! 

What is love? 
Baby don't hurt me, 
Don't hurt me, no more 
What is love? 
Baby don't hurt me, 
Don't hurt me, no more 
(Whooa whooa oo 2x)

Oh I don't know 
What can I do 
What else can I say, it's up to you 
I know we're one, 
Just me and you 
I can't go on 

What is love? 
Baby don't hurt me, 
Don't hurt me, no more 
What is love? 
Baby don't hurt me, 
Don't hurt me, no more

What is love? 
What is love? 
What is love? 
Baby don't hurt me, 
Don't hurt me, no more
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

I want no other 
No other lover 
This is our life, our time 
We are together 
I need you forever 
Is it love?
